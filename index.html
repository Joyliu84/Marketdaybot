    <div class="box">Cause I-I-I'm in the stars tonight
      So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight
      Shoes on, get up in the morn'
      Cup of milk, let's rock and roll
      King Kong, kick the drum, rolling on like a Rolling Stone
      Sing song when I'm walking home
      Jump up to the top, LeBron
      Ding dong, call me on my phone
      Ice tea and a game of ping pong
      This is getting heavy
      Can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready (woo hoo)
      Life is sweet as honey
      Yeah, this beat cha-ching like money, huh
      Disco overload, I'm into that, I'm good to go
      I'm diamond, you know I glow up
      Hey, so let's go
      'Cause I-I-I'm in the stars tonight
      So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight (hey)
      Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
      So I'ma light it up like dynamite, whoa oh oh
      Bring a friend, join the crowd
      Whoever wanna come along
      Word up, talk the talk
      Just move like we off the wall
      Day or night the sky's alight
      So we dance to the break of dawn
      Ladies and gentlemen, I got the medicine
      So you should keep ya eyes on the ball, huh
      This is getting heavy
      Can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready (woo hoo)
      Life is sweet as honey
      Yeah, this beat cha-ching like money
      Disco overload, I'm into that, I'm good to go
      I'm diamond, you know I glow up
      Let's go
      'Cause I-I-I'm in the stars tonight
      So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight (hey)
      Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
      So I'ma light it up like dynamite, whoa oh oh
      Dy-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na, na-na, life is dynamite
      Dy-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na, na-na, life is dynamite
      Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
      So I'ma light it up like dynamite, whoa oh oh

      'Cause I-I-I'm in the stars tonight
      So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight (alright, oh)
      Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
      So I'ma light it up like dynamite, whoa (light it up like dynamite)
